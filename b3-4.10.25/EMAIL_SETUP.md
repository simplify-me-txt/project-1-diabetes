# Email Functionality Setup

## Current Status
✅ **Email verification system is implemented and working**
✅ **Report sharing via email is implemented and working**
✅ **Email simulation is active for development/testing**

## Features Implemented

### 1. Registration Email Verification
- Users receive verification emails upon registration
- Email contains secure verification link
- Beautiful HTML email template with branding
- Users must verify email before they can login
- Verification tokens are secure and expire after use

### 2. Report Email Sharing
- Users can share diabetes prediction reports via email
- PDF reports are attached to emails
- Professional email templates for medical reports
- Share functionality available from results page and history

### 3. Development Email Simulation
- Currently using email simulation for testing
- All emails are logged to console with details
- No real emails sent (perfect for development)

## How to Enable Real Email Sending

### Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. Create a Gmail account or use existing one
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
4. Update `app.py` email configuration:
   ```python
   EMAIL_USERNAME = "your-email@gmail.com"
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your-16-digit-app-password"
   EMAIL_CONFIGURED = True  # Change this to True
   ```

### Option 2: Other SMTP Services
Update the SMTP settings in `app.py`:
```python
SMTP_SERVER = "your-smtp-server.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USERNAME = "your-email@domain.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your-password"
```

## Email Templates Included

### Verification Email
- Professional medical branding
- Secure verification button
- Responsive HTML design
- Clear instructions and security notes

### Report Sharing Email
- Medical report attachment (PDF)
- Professional medical communication
- Patient privacy notices
- Branded email signature

## Testing the Email System

### 1. Test Registration Email
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register \
  -d "username=testuser&email=test@email.com&password=test123&role=patient"
```

### 2. Test Report Email Sharing
1. Login to the system
2. Generate a diabetes prediction
3. Click "Share via Email" on results page
4. Enter recipient email address

### 3. Manual Email Verification
If you need to manually verify a user:
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('diabetes.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("UPDATE users SET is_verified = 1 WHERE email = 'user@email.com'")
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## Email Security Features

- ✅ Secure verification tokens using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`
- ✅ Tokens are one-time use and deleted after verification
- ✅ HTML email sanitization
- ✅ Professional medical email templates
- ✅ Privacy notices in all medical communications
- ✅ Fallback to simulation mode if email fails

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Use environment variables** for email credentials
2. **Enable SSL/TLS** for email security
3. **Configure proper FROM address** with your domain
4. **Set up email monitoring** to track delivery rates
5. **Test email deliverability** with different providers

## Current Configuration

The system is currently configured for **development with email simulation**. All email functionality works perfectly, with emails being logged to the console instead of being sent. This is ideal for testing without needing real email credentials.

To enable real email sending, simply update the email credentials in `app.py` and set `EMAIL_CONFIGURED = True`.
